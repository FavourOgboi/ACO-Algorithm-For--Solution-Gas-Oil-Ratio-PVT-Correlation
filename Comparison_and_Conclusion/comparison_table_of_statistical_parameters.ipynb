    "Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the comprehensive evaluation of our study on estimating Gas-Oil Ratio (GOR) using the Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) algorithm, several key findings and implications emerge:\n",
    "\n",
    "Development of Empirical Correlation: We have successfully developed an empirical correlation for estimating gas solubility at pressures below the bubble point, leveraging the ACO algorithm's optimization capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Performance Comparison: Our correlation outperforms established models such as Standing’s, Glaso’s, and Petrosky’s correlations when applied to differential liberation test data. The statistical analysis reveals significantly lower average percent relative error and a higher correlation coefficient, indicating superior predictive accuracy and reliability in estimating GOR.\n",
    "\n",
    "Engineering Reliability: Engineers can confidently rely on our newly developed correlation, especially after validating it with field data. It is well-established in literature that correlations perform optimally within the regions they are developed, ensuring robust applicability in practical scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "Optimization Tool Efficacy: The ACO algorithm, applied here to minimize the objective function, has demonstrated enhanced accuracy in predicting GOR. This underscores its effectiveness in optimizing parameter selection for gas solubility estimation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Future Directions: Future research should focus on enhancing the ACO algorithm's convergence rate to further improve its efficiency and applicability in real-time engineering applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, our study not only contributes a novel empirical correlation for GOR estimation but also showcases the effectiveness of the ACO algorithm in optimizing predictive models for oil and gas reservoir engineering. This work sets a foundation for further advancements in computational optimization techniques tailored to industry-specific challenges.\n",
    "\n",
    "From the comparison table of statistical parameters, several insights can be drawn:\n",
    "\n",
    "Accuracy and Precision: Your study shows significantly lower average percent relative error (1.44%) compared to the other correlations (ranging from 3.34% to 40.11%). This suggests that your model's predictions are closer to the actual values on average, indicating higher accuracy and precision in estimating Gas-Oil Ratio (GOR).\n",
    "\n",
    "Model Fit: The sum squared residuals in your study (471) are notably lower than those in the other correlations (ranging from 364,985 to 522,387). A lower sum squared residual indicates that your model's predictions deviate less from the actual data points, implying a better fit of your model to the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Correlation Strength: Your correlation coefficient (0.9994) is higher than those reported in the other studies (ranging from 0.8097 to 0.998). A higher correlation coefficient indicates a stronger linear relationship between the variables tested, suggesting that your model's predictions align closely with the actual GOR values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Validation and Reliability: The combination of low average percent relative error, low sum squared residuals, and high correlation coefficient indicates that your model performs well in predicting GOR values. This suggests that your model is robust and reliable for estimating GOR based on the given parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, these insights highlight that your study's model not only performs well in terms of accuracy and precision but also demonstrates a strong fit and reliability compared to established correlations in the field."
